# Models of Suppl Chain Systems

## Little's Law
 \(I=R\times T\) (or \(L=\lambda W\))
 I (Inventory/Work-in-Process): Average items in the system.
 R (Throughput/Rate): Average items flowing out per unit of time (e.g., units/day).
 T (Flow Time/Lead Time): Average time a unit spends in the system.
